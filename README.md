# HackaTUM23
Our solution for the Burda challenge at HackaTUM23. We Leverage AI generated video to enhance the integration of mute people in the workplace by enabling them to give presentations with their avatar. We simplify as much as possible the generation of the presentations, by allowing them to use a web app where they just need to upload a selfie and a powerpoint presentation.
